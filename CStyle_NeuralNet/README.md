# C++ Neural Network
배열로 만든 단순한 NN 구현 목표
 
# Solved Issues
1. Memory Leak 
2. Ensure Object Independence
3. CleanUp-Code
5. Iteration Optimized

# To Change
1. Erase Deep Copy Code
2. Despite using Thread-pool, It's Fuxxing Slow! -> I think that this is synchronized problem.....
3. Since Modern C++ is Significantly Slow, I think I should use C-Style.

# To Add
1. Add Bias Back Propogation 
2. Add CNN, RNN(LMTS)
3. Add Module that manage Inputs(To parse .csv, .png formats) 
4. Add CUDA Version
